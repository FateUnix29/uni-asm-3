# Universal Assembler 3

**Work in progress!**

uni-asm-3, otherwise known as Universal Assembler 3, is my third edition of an attempt to make an assembler in Python that can assemble any assembly file given it's ISA, and choose the output format.
This makes it extremely powerful as you can swap the ISA, the assembly file, the output method, etc.

**THIS IS NOT A MODULE/IMPORT**

Attempting to import this will raise an error.
